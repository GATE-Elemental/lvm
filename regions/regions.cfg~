# Region Data
#
# This file can be split up into multiple files, if different region
# definitions are desired.
# For example, if justice.cfg exists, it will be used for Guarded, etc
#
# Like any other region file, regions only override regions found earlier in the file.
#

#    Guarded    0/1     Is the justice region guarded?
#    EnterText  [text]  Text to display upon entry
